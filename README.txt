Hi!

1-With your preferred text editor, open the config.php file and edit the first 4 variables with your MySQL Details. Read the comments.
2.Upload all the files to your server
3.Open the install.php site on your webpage. e.g. If you uploaded the files to http://mysite.com/invento, go to http://mysite.com/invento/install.php. cheminventory will be installed automatically
4.Once cheminventory is installed, write down your username/password and delete the install.php file.
5.Log into your cheminventory account and change your password immediately

Go to index.php.
